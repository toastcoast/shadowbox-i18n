# HELLO

this is a test again, but different.  

this is a new line.  

this is a paragraph. There are many idiosyncratic typing styles in between novice-style 'hunt and peck' and touch typing. For example, many 'hunt and peck' typists have the keyboard layout memorized and are able to type while focusing their gaze on the screen. This sentence is new.  Some use just two fingers, while others use 3-6 fingers, this sentence is edited. Some use their fingers very consistently, with the same finger being used to type the same character every time, while others vary the way they use their fingers. the end.  

this  is a new paragraph.

this is a new line.
